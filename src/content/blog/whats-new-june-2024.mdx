### Content

Here's what caught our attention this month: 

{/* - 📺 Watch @WebDevSimplified [recreate Shadcn's Docs in 30 minutes with Starlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pq80drDrNs). We're not sure **we** would say "Building documentation for a library is one of the worst parts of any project!" But for those who think so, see why Starlight takes that task from painful to delightful!
